    <p>Citrullus lanatus is a plant species in the family Cucurbitaceae, a vine-like (scrambler and trailer) flowering plant
        originally from Africa. It is cultivated for its fruit. The subdivision of this species into two varieties, watermelons
        (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) var. lanatus) and citron melons (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (L. H. Bailey) Mansf.),
        originated with the erroneous synonymization of Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai and Citrullus vulgaris
        Schrad. by L.H. Bailey in 1930.[2] Molecular data including sequences from the original collection of Thunberg and
        other relevant type material, show that the sweet watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad.) and the bitter wooly melon
        Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai are not closely related to each other.[3] Since 1930, thousands of papers
        have misapplied the name Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai for the watermelon, and a proposal to conserve
        the name with this meaning was accepted by the relevant nomenclatural committee and confirmed at the International
        Botanical Congress in Shenzhen.[4] The bitter South African melon first collected by Thunberg has become naturalized
        in semiarid regions of several continents, and is designated as a "pest plant" in parts of Western Australia where
        they are called pig melon.[5] Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a scrambling and trailing vine in the flowering plant
        family Cucurbitaceae. The species was long thought to have originated in southern Africa, but this was based on the
        erroneous synonymization by L. H. Bailey (1930) of a South African species with the cultivated watermelon [6]. The
        error became apparent with DNA comparison of material of the cultivated watermelon seen and named by Linnaeus and
        the holotype of the South African species[7]. There is evidence from seeds in Pharao tombs of watermelon cultivation
        in Ancient Egypt. Watermelon is grown in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide for its large edible fruit, also
        known as a watermelon, which is a special kind of berry with a hard rind and no internal division, botanically called
        a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties have
        been cultivated. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled and the rind is edible after cooking. Considerable breeding
        effort has been put into disease-resistant varieties. Many cultivars are available that produce mature fruit within
        100 days of planting the crop. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon

        <h3>Watermelon fun facts</h3>
        <p>Watermelons are a sweet, popular fruit of summer, usually consumed fresh in slices, diced in mixed fruit salads,
            or as juice. Watermelon juice can be blended with other fruit juices or made into wine. The seeds have a nutty
            flavor and can be dried and roasted, or ground into flour. In China, the seeds are eaten at Chinese New Year
            celebrations. In Vietnamese culture, watermelon seeds are consumed during the Vietnamese New Year's holiday,
            Tết, as a snack. Watermelon rinds may be eaten, but most people avoid eating them due to their unappealing flavor.
            They are used for making pickles, sometimes eaten as a vegetable, stir-fried or stewed. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon</p>
